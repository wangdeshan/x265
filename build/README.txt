Compiling x265 requires cmake to be installed to generate project
or Makefiles for your preferred compiler.  See http://www.cmake.org

Most users simply can use the batch files in the compiler-specific
sub-directories.

If you wish to use a compiler that does not have a build folder, you can
simply run: `cmake -G GENERATOR ../source`  See the CMAKE documentation
for the list of supported generators
