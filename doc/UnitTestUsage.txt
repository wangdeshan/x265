Testbench draft version :- 

    the tools is used to validate the output for all the vectorised vs non vectorised primitives 
    and the additional features are also implemented to identify the bench marking for the vectorised vs non vectorised primitives
    this will give the total time taken for all the vectorised vs non vectorised primitives
    
    usage - ./testbench --bench   -> this will do the bench marking for all the primitive functions 
            ./testbench  -> Do the output comparision for vectorised vs non vectorised primitives
            
            single primitive check
            ./testbench --primitive 1
